# MyDotFiles

This is simply my dotfiles repository of configured software and system configured for archlinux and some of them for macOS. It's inspired by the great community, which I very grateful. It's not completed yet. I will add more dotfiles and scripts to it. Add make it better.

## Repository about

I think the categories are in the best situation and sorted by me. I think the this type of sort is good for it, but if you have any suggestion please contact me and we can talk about it.

The repo is clear and I don't think need any advice or other tips.

## What are those wierd files ?

I make a table for them, maybe some of them are not in the list so if you find out tell me and help me which one . :)
Thanks
